# sudoku_solver
One day my friend Xiangpeng asked me to solve a sudoku puzzle. I said that it seems easy but I burned my life to solve it in fact. Aftermath, I began to think that I may write some small code with a simple recurrence method to do sudoku automatically. 

So I made it but it kills the joy of playing the sudoku.

Merde. :p
